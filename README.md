 This repo contains an implementation  for a True Random Number Generator based on boson sampling using qiskit platform with quantum programming.  This code is prepared for the Womanium Quantum Computing and Entrepreneuship Program - Quantum Hackaton - and this challenge is proposed by ORCA Computing.

ABOUT OUR SOLUTION:
In this repository we implemented a random number generator using boson sampling.

We run the code in Qbraid platform and in the Jupyter notebook platform.

Run time measurements is also calculated by the code.

We made a comparative analysis of the runtime results in both platforms.

We have also analyzed the randomness of the outcome sequence using some known randomness tests.
